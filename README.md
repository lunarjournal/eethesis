ECE Undegraduate Research Project
Project Title: Self-Encrypting USB Password Manager
```

`Architecture`: `8-bit AVR ATmega328P`

The goal of my final year research project was to design a self-encrypting `USB` based hardware password manager. 

Single sign on (`SSO`) capability was also another requirement for the project. `SSO` capability allows an end user to log into any of their online accounts through a single, unified interface.

Credentials were required to be securely stored in an encrypted form and then subsequently decrypted during an `SSO` login session. 

The approach to this problem involved utilizing two `ATMega328P` `MCU's`. The first `MCU`, termed the auxiliary `MCU` implemented a `RSA-1024` `crypto` module as well as a custom `EEPROM` based filesystem to store encrypted credentials using the [`minicore`](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore) software stack and bootloader. 

Next a `USB` `CDC` `ACM` device class was implemented in firmware using the `V-USB` driver stack and flashed onto another `ATMega328P` `MCU`, termed the `USB` `MCU`.

The auxiliary and `USB` `MCU's` `UART` transceivers were then connected together to enable `serial` communications between both `MCU's`. On `Linux`, `CDC` `ACM` devices appear as virtual `serial` ports (`/dev/ttyACM*`) and this finally allowed for virtual `serial` communications between the host `PC` and the auxilliary `MCU` via the `USB` `MCU`.

A software client was then developed and consisted of a chrome browser extension to manage credentials through a `UI` interface as well as a native host (using google chrome's native messsaging `API`) to enable `serial` communication between the chrome browser extension and the auxiliary `MCU`. 

The native host was also responsible for decrypting credentials as well as generating `RSA` keys and made use of `OpenSSL's` `C` `API` for these tasks.

This repository consists of three sub branches (folders):
* `firmware` - `auxiliary` and `USB` driver `MCU` firmware.
* `software` - `browser` extension and native `host` source.
* `report` - `latex` source code of report.

Files:
<br/>
* `report.pdf` - compiled `PDF` version of the project report.
* `topic.pdf` - original topic `PDF.`
* `poster.pdf` - project `poster`.
